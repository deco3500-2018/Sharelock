How to Use:  
In our app, we have three main functions. The UI style is in a sharp and hale style, using Hot magenta as the theme colour. First, it provides a skill board for users to post information about projects, human resource, technical questions and upcoming event etc. Having this platform on hand, everyone gets a fast access to the circle. In the prototype, it is available to post comment and images like normal social net work. Secondly, a powerful category to about the craft technology and who is working in that field that users can join and share skills. Also, a list about how people like this people. You can message them or view the profile by a simple click. Apart from individual skill category, we sill provide a group project function on top tag, where user can view and join different group doing with different amazing projects. Thirdly, a Brisbane map view of all the shared workshop and the basic information of them with a link to the official website. This map is useful when the user searches the appropriate workshop and makes an appointment with others.
